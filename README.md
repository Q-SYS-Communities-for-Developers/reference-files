# CSS Reference File

This file is intended to be used for **_reference purposes only_**. The linked CSS style contains multiple images and is designed as a reference, not as part of an efficient panel. This reference file contains multiple examples of different ways to style common controls. Please use it as a guide when creating your own panels.

## Description

  - The instructions for each control are located on the "01 - Instructions" schematic page and linked to the UCI via script
